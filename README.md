## Unity + VR:
* Basics of Unity and C#
* Flying Platform
* Virtual Reality

### Basic of Unity and C#
* Unity + Oculus Set Up
    * This took extremely more time than I imagined and hoped, as Unity is so so large, Unity download kept crashing, there were several different versions, and I have no previous experience of either Unity or Oculus.

### 3D Flying Platform
* What did I learn?
    * Wrote my first script regarding movement
    * Learned C# Syntax

### Virtual Reality (Touch the box with rays and hands!)
* What did I learn?
    * Learned that it's possible to incorporate hand movement.
    * I have a firmer belief in the direction of the project: I really feel as though conducting an orchestra with this would be cool!
    * Created a simple game where you make the boxes disappear with your hands!
